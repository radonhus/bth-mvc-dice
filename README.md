# Game 21

This is a small web-based game project to practice on object-oriented
programming. The game was programmed as part of a course at Blekinge
Technical University, BTH.

## Object of the game
Get an accumulated dice value as close to 21 as possible. The user can roll the
dice as many times as they like. The computer then rolls the dice. The computer
wins if the user and the computer sums are equal. Otherwise, the player with
the highest sum (<= 21) wins.
