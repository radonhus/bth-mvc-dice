# Dice Games

This is a small web-based dice games project to practice object-oriented
programming. The games were programmed as part of a course at Blekinge
Technical University, BTH.

## Game 21
Get an accumulated dice value as close to 21 as possible. The user can roll the
dice as many times as they like. The computer then rolls the dice. The computer
wins if the user and the computer sums are equal. Otherwise, the player with
the highest sum (<= 21) wins.

## Yatzy
Play against yourself. Each round consists of three rolls: one initial, and
then two chances to improve the result by rerolling a selection of the dice.
At the end of each round, you can choose which dice you would like to be counted.
If the total score you get is 63 or higher, a 50 point bonus is awarded.
